# SmartBread: A 6502 based single-board computer 
Its name came from a friend who called it this when they saw my initial prototypes on a breadboard. 

# What is it?
Other than another 6502 based single board computer, of which many exist, this was many firsts for me. Starting in 2017, I had a goal to build a 6502 system on a breadboard. 

As it grew, it became my first real endeavour into 6502 assembly, coding for an actual system, trying to make user friendly software, and PCB making. I now have working PCBs, a few programs, and much more work to do. 

# Disclaimer: 
This was my first stab at assembly of any kind. While the code does exactly what I want it to do for this system, I understand that my code is not pretty by any stretch, and there is tons of room for improvement. I'm a novice, so please go easy on me.
